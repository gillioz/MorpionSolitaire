    "Let us begin with the network. Instead of having one convolutional layer with a big kernel doing all the work, we slice our model into several layers. The advantage of doing so is that each individual layer need not be as complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first layer will be a convolutional layer with a 3 x 3 kernel and stride 3: \n",
    "its role is to break down the grid into blocks of 3 x 3 pixels, each corresponding to a point (the pixel at the center) and 8 segments attached to it (one in each direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we add four more convolutional layer with kernel size 2 x 2. Their role is to examine the relations between nearest neighbors. The input of the first of these layers is a block of 3 x 3 pixels; its ouputs have a receiptive field of 2 x 2 blocks, or 6 x 6 pixels. After 4 layers, the receptive field is 5 x 5 blocks, or 15 x 15 pixels. This is sufficient to detect the relevant features that are spreading over 13 x 13 pixels at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of sufficiently many possible combinations of neighboring blocks, we use 40 channels in each layer (a bit less in the first layer). This number is motivated by the fact that there are eventually 5 combinations of lines and dots in 4 directions that give a possible move, and therefore 20 different features to discover. Using twice as many channel should be sufficient to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the network consists of a pooling layer, followed by a couple of linear layers to turn the output into a single number. As a warm-up, we train the network on the same problem as [last time](/2022/01/07/Part_3_Binary_problem.html). For this we use max pooling and two linear layers only.\n",

In between, it varies a lot, and it is not uncommon to encounter grids with more than 30 different possible moves.\n",
