For instance it is not only pleasing for the eye but also efficient if the grids is filling up some region as much as possible, meaning that all points and lines (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) are drawn there. Empty segments between lines are useless, and I try to avoid them as much as possible.\n",

    "Evaluating the potential of a given move is something that a deep neural network should be able to do. Like in computer chess, one can evaluate the situation at any given step of the game, for instance asking for an estimate of the number of moves that one can expect to make. This estimate can be very precise when there are only a few moves left, or quite rough at the beginning of a game. In any case, the reach of a computer exploration can be vastly improved if the next move is decided based on this approximate evaluation: if I can combine the ability of the neural net to assess the situation in the same way as I do when I play, together with the possibility to play many many games (which I don't have), then I hope to reach interesting results.\n",
