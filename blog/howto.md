Blogging with Jupyter Notebooks 
===============================

Preparing the notebook
----------------------

Create a directory to put images with `mkdir <name>_images`.

Put existing relevant images in that directory, and include them using a markdown cell of the form `![](images/<image>.png 'legend')`

For images that are generated by a code cell, use
```python
plt.savefig('<name>_images/<image>.png', bbox_inches='tight')
plt.show()
```

Use `#hide` at the beginning of a code cell to hide its content in the blog.




Exporting to markdown
---------------------

1. Clear all outputs with `Cell > All Output > Clear`
1. Export to markdown with `File > Download as > Markdown (.md)`
1. In a terminal, run `python remove_hide.py <name>.md` to remove unwanted code cells
1. Copy `<name>.md` to the `_posts` folder in the blog repo
1. Rename it `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-<name>.md` there
1. Copy `<name>_images` to the `images` folder in the blog repo
1. Commit and push the blog repo to GitHub
