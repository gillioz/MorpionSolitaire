Models
======

All models are saved in PyTorch format and can therefore be loaded with the command
```python
torch.load(model_name.pt)
```

The models are named after scientists who played a pivotal role in the development of [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism) in the European culture, among which:
- [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus), often considered the father of atomism
- [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon), one of the first to disseminate atomistic views in the Renaissance period
- [Ren√© Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), father of the cartesian philosophy
